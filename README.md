# 🧩 Crossword Crafter - Algorithmic Word Placement and Optimization

Welcome to **Crossword Crafter**, a full-stack web application that dynamically generates and solves crossword puzzles using advanced algorithmic techniques. Developed as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (TCS-409)** coursework, this project demonstrates the practical application of backtracking, Trie structures, BFS/DFS, and local search optimization strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview

Crossword puzzles have long challenged players with language, logic, and pattern recognition. Our project moves beyond static puzzle design to **dynamically generate and solve crosswords** using efficient algorithms and optimized data structures.
This innovative solution showcases real-world use of algorithms in game-based systems and pushes the boundaries of NP-hard problem-solving using modern tech stacks.
## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Dynamic grid generation with optimal word placement
- ✅ Clue validation and automatic solver using backtracking
- ✅ Trie-based fast dictionary lookup
- ✅ Clean, responsive UI for seamless gameplay
- ✅ Full-stack architecture with Spring Boot and React.js
- ✅ MySQL integration for persistent storage
- ✅ REST API backend with Axios communication
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility and tested edge cases

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Frontend**:
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- React Hot Toast
- Axios

**Backend**:
- Java with Spring Boot
- Spring Web, JPA, Jackson
- MySQL

**Architecture**:
- Clear separation of concerns with Controllers, Services, and Models
